         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>P. 19. SPeaking of <hi>Cornelius,</hi> Acts 10. the Author hath theſe words, <q>Now what had become of him, if he had Died, before he had heard of the <hi>Outward Chriſt.</hi> I will not ſay, but I think, we may ſafely conclude, That if he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected the <hi>Preaching of Peter,</hi> and depended, as the <hi>Quakers</hi> do, upon the <hi>Sufficiency</hi> of the <hi>Light within, without any thing elſe,</hi> all his former <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> would not have Sav'd him, nor his <hi>Light within.</hi>

                  <hi>GEORGE KEITH</hi> his ſaying, That the Light within is not Sufficient without <hi>ſomething elſe,</hi> Prov'd to be contrary to the Foundation of the Chriſtian Religion.</q>

            <p>P. 42. His (<hi>Danſon</hi>'s) words are theſe, <q>As for their Participating of the Infallible Spirit (if that were granted) that infers not a Participation of the Spirit's Infallibility; as indeed (ſays this Author) it does not, more than of its <hi>Omnipotence, Omniſcience,</hi> or any other of the Divine Attributes.</q>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Moſt certainly, the <hi>Participation of the Divine Nature</hi> does imply a Participation of <hi>Omnipotence,</hi> and <hi>Omniſcience,</hi> viz A Power to KNOW All things, and to DO All things, from Time to Time; which it is our Duty for the Preſent to Know and Do. This Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of <hi>Omnipotence,</hi> and <hi>Omniſcience,</hi> all thoſe that are Partakers of the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> as ſuch, are moſt certainly Endued withal by the <hi>Father of Lights,</hi> the Fountain of all Goodneſs: And it is Impoſſible they ſhould <hi>Err</hi> ſo far, as they <hi>Adhere</hi> to the <hi>Spirit of Truth.</hi>

               <hi>W. P.</hi> declares the <hi>Quakers</hi> Meaning in theſe words in his <hi>KEY,</hi> p. 7. <q>They ſay, the Principle is Pure, Perfect, Unerrable in it ſelf, or elſe it were unfit to lead Men out of <hi>Error</hi> and Impurity to Heaven: But they never did aſſert themſelves ſuch, meerly becauſe it was in them; by no means: But that all who are led by it, <hi>are ſo far Perfect, and ſo far Infallibly in the Right Way, as they are led by it, and no jot far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>

P. 66. <q>This ſhews us the Heart of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> who are not ſatisfied with the <hi>Influences, and Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Chriſt:</hi> But will have the very Perſon of CHRIST within them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> If CHRIST be the True and Eternal God, the very <hi>Perſon of CHRIST,</hi> or CHRIST HIM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SELF is in All Creatures, and in a Peculiar Manner in All Rational Creatures. Every GOOD Motion in the Heart and Perception of TRUTH in the Mind of Man, comes IMMEDIATELY from the very Perſon of CHRIST, or CHRIST HIMSELF In the Soul, or <hi>Inward Man.</hi> Whoever ſincerely Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves, that CHRIST is the True and Eternal GOD, does <hi>Virtually</hi> Believe this: Which he that <hi>Formally and Expreſly</hi> Believes, finds Infinitely more Joy and Satisfaction in the <hi>Explicitneſs</hi> of that Belief, and the KNOWLEDGE of the Daily Effects of it, than He could have in all the Learning, that Mankind is capable of, without the <hi>Sanctifying Inſpiration</hi> of the Only Wiſe GOD, from which nothing can <hi>Exclude</hi> us, but the <hi>Perverſneſs of our own Will.</hi> We do not Affirm, that the Body of Chriſt is otherwiſe In us, than upon this account, that it is In Him, in whom are All things; who is as truly and really In us, as He is In Heaven. This Doctrine, that the Perſon of CHRIST, or <hi>Chriſt Himſelf,</hi> the True and Eternal LIGHT is In us, is ſo far from being the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Errors,</hi> as this Learned <hi>Man</hi> Aſſerts, that it is the Foundation of All EVANGELICAL Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; but I grant that Every Man has a VIRTU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>AL, or <hi>Implicit</hi> Knowledge of this Truth, who ſo Truſts in GOD for <hi>Chriſt's ſake,</hi> to cleanſe the Thoughts of his Heart, by the Inſpiration of his <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> that Commonly, or <hi>Habitually,</hi> he is in ſuch a

            <p>
               <q>It is, ſays this Learned Man, the True and Real Virtue, and Light of Chriſt, which from him in Heaven is convey'd into our <hi>Hearts.</hi> And what more would the <hi>Quakers</hi> have? Nothing leſs than the very Body and Perſon of <hi>CHRIST</hi> within them. This is the Foundation of all the <hi>Quakers Errors.</hi>
